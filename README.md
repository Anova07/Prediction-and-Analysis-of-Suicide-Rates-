# Prediction-and-Analysis-of-Suicide-Rates-

In this digital age, the pressure to perform and succeed can often lead to depression and, in extreme cases, death. Suicide is defined as the deliberate act of causing one's death. They are increasing at an alarming rate all over the world, and it is important to reduce the number of suicides taking place. Suicide attempts have serious emotional, physical, and financial ramifications. Although a single factor cannot be pinpointed, among the common factors leading towards taking the extreme step, some of them can be analyzed through this project. A visualization of these could give us a better understanding of the causes of their suicide. A prediction plot of the overall rate of suicides in the future years is found using regression algorithms. A culminated model was created to predict the total count of suicide based on various factors including state, age group, and Year. These results would be helpful to reduce the number of suicide rates in the world and create awareness among people. The ‘R’ language was used to perform data analytics

# Conclusion and Future work:

Various machine learning models were implemented and arrived at the following conclusions by looking at the results and visualization. The number of suicide cases are escalating year by year. A cause of concern observed during data cleaning is that many suicides are unclassified. Males tend to end their lives as compared to females. People belonging to the age group of 15-44 constitute for most suicide cases. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal are the states having the most number of suicides in India. The major factors include family problems, prolonged illness, and insanity. Education is an essential factor in combating suicide, as with increase in education level, the suicide count drops. The culminated machine learning model indicates that the suicide count varies based on state and age group, but the factor that remains constant is that the suicide count is predicted to go higher and higher every year. Hence immediate actions have to be taken to bring awareness to the general public about mental health issues, ensure that they stay in a healthy state of mind and are able to stay strong when faced with problems so that they never consider the act of suicide.
